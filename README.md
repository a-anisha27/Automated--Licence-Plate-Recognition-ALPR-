Title:Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)

Purpose:
The goal of this project is to develop an Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)system capable of identifying and reading vehicle license plates from images or video feeds. This system can be applied in areas such as traffic monitoring, toll collection, law enforcement, and smart parking systems.

Technologies Used:
Python 3.x– Programming language
OpenCV– Image processing and plate detection
Tesseract OCR / EasyOCR– Optical Character Recognition for plate text
NumPy – Numerical computing
Matplotlib / Streamlit– Visualization and optional 
Flask (optional) – Web deployment (if web app is built)

Usage:
1. Traffic Management:
Monitoring traffic flow, congestion, and violations (speeding, red-light running).
Automatic toll collection on highways (ETC systems).
2. Law Enforcement:
Identifying stolen or wanted vehicles in real-time.
Enforcing parking regulations and detecting expired registrations.
3. Access Control:
Securing entry/exit points in gated communities, office buildings, and parking lots.
4. Security and Surveillance:
Enhancing security at critical infrastructures like airports and government buildings.
Tracking suspect vehicles during investigations.
5. Logistics and Fleet Management:
Tracking commercial fleet movement for optimization and security.

Conclusion:
This ALPR project combines computer vision and OCR to provide an automated solution for license plate detection and recognition. It lays the foundation for more advanced systems in surveillance, intelligent transport, and urban security. With further improvements like deep learning-based detection, multi-language OCR, and database integration, it can scale for real-world deployment.
